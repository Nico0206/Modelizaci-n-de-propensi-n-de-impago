El conjunto de entrenamiento se divide aleatoriamente en $ N $ subconjuntos distintos llamados pliegues, luego el modelo se entrena y evalúa $ N $ veces mediante el uso de un pliegue diferente para la evaluación de un modelo que se entrena en los otros $ N-1 $ pliegues. Los resultados del procedimiento consisten en puntajes de evaluación de $ N $ para cada métrica que luego se promedian.

En la recuperación de información, la precisión es una medida de la relevancia de los resultados, mientras que la recuperación es una medida de cuántos resultados verdaderamente relevantes se devuelven. Intuitivamente, la precisión es la capacidad del clasificador de no etiquetar como positiva una muestra negativa, y la recuperación es la capacidad del clasificador de encontrar todas las muestras positivas.\n",

        "Un sistema con alta recuperación pero baja precisión devuelve muchas etiquetas que tienden a predecirse incorrectamente en comparación con las etiquetas de entrenamiento. Un sistema con alta precisión pero poca recuperación es todo lo contrario, arrojando muy pocos resultados, pero la mayoría de las etiquetas predichas son correctas en comparación con las etiquetas de entrenamiento. Un sistema ideal con alta precisión y alta recuperación devolverá muchos resultados, con muchos resultados etiquetados correctamente.\n",

        "En lineas generales el modelo demuestra una alta exactitud. No obstante, el Recall (R) en el conjunto de test sigue siendo muy bajo a pesar de todos los cambios que he intentado hacer para tenerlo mas alto. He aplicado variables financieras como \"prediccion de salario\" o incluso la deuda basada en los ingresos (DIT). También, he limpiado los datos remplazando los valores nulos por la mediana ya que esta es mas \"robusta\" a valores atipicos la cual preserva la distribucion original en comparacion con la media por ejemplo. Entonces ya es algo que se necesitaria un analisis mas profundo. Ya comparando los resultados del model de prediccion de impagos antes y despues de optimizar los parametros este no ha cambiado mucho, de hecho baja el cual es atipico.\n",
        "\n",
        "En los parametros después de la optimizacion hay de hecho una disminucion ligera en el recall que nosotros lo tenemos explicado arriba como \"La Recuperacion\" la cual decrece de 0,58 a 0,51. Esto puede ser debido a que al optimizar los parámetros, es posible que el modelo se haya ajustado demasiado a los datos de entrenamiento, lo que puede llevar a un menor rendimiento en datos nuevos. Incluso esto puede ser debido a un desequilibrio de las clases ya que si tenemos una mas frecuente que la otra el modelo puede estar sesgado hacia la clase mayoritaria. Sin embargo, esta metrica es clave y mas para este caso financiero ya que mide la capacidad de un modelo para identificar todos los casos REALES de una clase especifica.\n",
        "\n",
        "En este contexto, el recall indica la proporcion de prestamos que realmente incumplieron y que el modelo identifico corrctamente como tales como esta explicado arriba del todo. Recall = Verdaderos Positivos / (Verdaderos positivos + Falsos Negativos). Este dato puede ser preocupante para las entidades financieras ya que en este caso solo esta identificando correctamente el 51% de los prestamos que realmente incumpliran. El 49% restante de los impagos reales seran pasados por alto por el modelo, lo que podria generar perdidas financieras. Un F1 score de 0.64 indica que el modelo tiene un rendimiento moderado en la tarea de clasificación. No es un valor bajo como el recall pero si tiene margen de mejora.\n",
        "\n",
        "En resumen, el modelo muestra una alta precision (0,84) en la prediccion de los impagos, lo que significa que cuando este predice un impago, es muy probable que sea correcto. Sin embargo, tiene un recall muy bajo, lo que significa que esta pasando por alto una parte significativa de los impagos reales. El F1 score se encuentra en un valor moderado, reflejando esta situacion. Un sistema con alta precisión pero poca recuperación (recall) es todo lo contrario, arrojando muy pocos resultados, pero la mayoría de las etiquetas predichas son correctas en comparación con las etiquetas de entrenamiento. Un sistema ideal con alta precisión y alta recuperación devolverá muchos resultados, con muchos resultados etiquetados correctamente.\n",
        "\n",
        "Algunas estrategias que me parecen interesantes para aumentar el recall del modelo que estan en nuestra mano son las siguientes:\n",
        "1. **Manejar el desequilibrio de Clases:**\n",
        "En este caso si nuestro dataset tiene muchos mas prestamos sin impago que con impago, el modelo podria estar sesgado hacia la clase mayoritaria. Para poder abordar este problema podriamos aplicar tecnicas como Oversampling, Undersampling o pesos de clase. Incluso al principio del modelo podemos ver como hay mucho mas prestamos por Hipoteca que por Prestamo personal, tal vez este sea un indicio de oversampling.\n",
        "2. **Ajustar el umbral de decisión:** El modelo predice la probabilidad de impago y, por defecto, utiliza un umbral de 0.5 para clasificar un préstamo como impago o no. Podemos ajustar este umbral para favorecer el recall, sin embargo no estoy muy seguro ya que no hemos tocado esto en clase. Reducir el umbral aumentará el recall, pero también podría disminuir la precisión.\n",
        "3. **Probar otros algoritmos:** LightGBM es un buen algoritmo pero podriamos probar con Random Forest, XGBoost o incluso redes neuronales\n",
